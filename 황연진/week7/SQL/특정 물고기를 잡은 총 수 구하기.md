# 풀이

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS FISH_COUNT
FROM FISH_INFO I
JOIN FISH_NAME_INFO N
ON I.FISH_TYPE = N.FISH_TYPE
WHERE N.FISH_NAME = "BASS" OR N.FISH_NAME = "SNAPPER"

# 다른 풀이
SELECT COUNT(*) AS FISH_COUNT
FROM FISH_INFO I
JOIN FISH_NAME_INFO N
ON I.FISH_TYPE = N.FISH_TYPE
WHERE N.FISH_NAME IN ("BASS", "SNAPPER")

# 다른 풀이
SELECT COUNT(*) AS FISH_COUNT
FROM FISH_INFO
WHERE FISH_TYPE IN (
    SELECT FISH_TYPE
    FROM FISH_NAME_INFO
    WHERE FISH_NAME IN ("BASS", "SNAPPER")
)

# 다른 풀이
SELECT COUNT(*) AS FISH_COUNT
FROM FISH_INFO AS I
WHERE EXISTS(
    SELECT *
    FROM FISH_NAME_INFO AS N
    WHERE I.FISH_TYPE = N.FISH_TYPE AND N.FISH_NAME IN ("BASS", "SNAPPER")
)
```


# 해설
* BASS와 SNAPPER : `WHERE N.FISH_NAME = "BASS" OR N.FISH_NAME = "SNAPPER"`
* 물고기 수 : `SELECT COUNT(*) AS FISH_COUNT`
